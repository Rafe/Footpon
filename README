PROJECT:
Footpon is an application that operates in two phases, 
the hunting phase and the retrieval phase.
The hunting phase is when the phone acts as a pedometer.
Based on the amount of steps taken and the GPS difference,
a user will gain points that can be used in the retrieval phase.
A map will be displayed with marked locations of participating 
shops and traveling in these areas will result in more points 
being gained.
The second phase is the retrieval phase and occurs when the person is at a marked location. At a marked location, the person will be able to view coupons for that shop and redeem them with the points that they got from the hunting phase.
This application will benefit both shoppers with savings and participating shops with more business.
